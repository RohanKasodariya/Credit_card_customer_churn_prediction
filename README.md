# Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains a project aimed at predicting the likelihood of customer churn in a credit card company using various machine learning techniques. Customer churn is a significant challenge for businesses, and predicting it can help in taking proactive measures to retain customers.

## üóÇ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the probability of a customer leaving the credit card company based on various behavioral and demographic features. This project demonstrates the use of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and multiple classification models to address a binary classification problem.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
- **CustomerID**: Unique ID for each customer.
- **Credit Score**: Credit score of the customer.
- **Geography**: The country where the customer resides.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Tenure**: Number of years the customer has been with the company.
- **Balance**: Account balance of the customer.
- **NumOfProducts**: Number of products the customer has with the company.
- **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer has a credit card (0 or 1).
- **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is an active member (0 or 1).
- **EstimatedSalary**: Estimated salary of the customer.
- **Exited**: Target variable indicating whether the customer has churned (0 or 1).

## üß† Modeling Approach

The project employs various machine learning techniques to predict customer churn:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distributions, correlations, and identifying key factors influencing churn.
- **Model Building**: Implementing multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### Model Details:
- **Baseline Model**: Logistic Regression as a simple baseline.
- **Advanced Models**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilizing Grid Search and Random Search to find the best hyperparameters for each model.
